# Ignore pnpm lock file
pnpm-lock.yaml

# Generated files
src/database/migrations

# Notes:
# By default, Prettier will ignore:
# - Files in version control systems directories (".git", ".jj", ".sl", ".svn" and ".hg")
# - node_modules
# - Files ignored by ".gitignore" file in the same directory
# So, if the code you want to ignore is already in those categories, you don't need to add them to this file
# See https://prettier.io/docs/ignore for more information
